## Dark Mode

- Toggle the dark mode using the button with the moon (üåô) / sun (‚òÄÔ∏è) icon at the top-right corner.  
- The colors of the interface and buttons update accordingly.

## Code Overview

- `click(value)`: Handles button presses and updates the calculator display or evaluates expressions.  
- `key_press(event)`: Maps keyboard presses to button actions.  
- `toggle_dark_mode()`: Switches between light and dark themes and updates the UI colors.  
- The GUI is constructed with Tkinter frames, buttons, and labels, arranged to fill the window responsively.
